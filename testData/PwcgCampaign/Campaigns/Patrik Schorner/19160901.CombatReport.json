  "narrative": "\nA very effective mission.  We come across two groups of pushers, one French and one British, flying in parallel not at all far from each other.  I set upon one of the Frenchmen as the rest of the flight goes for an Englishman.  I fire continuously into him.  His aircraft absorbs tremendous damage before finally disintegrating and crashing.  \n\nI turn to see my comrades attacking the English pusher.  They are causing harm but not inflicting a fatal blow.\n\nI move on to the second Frenchman.  I fire at point blank before running out of ammunition.  I pull away but the damage is done.  His engine quits and he is forced to land behind our lines.  \n\n\n\n\n\n",
