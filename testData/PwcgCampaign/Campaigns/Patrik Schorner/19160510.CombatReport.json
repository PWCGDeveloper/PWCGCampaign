  "narrative": "\nMy first mission in a scout and a vctory is acheived!  A wonderful start.  FOur of us on patrol set upon two British pusher scouts flying over our lines.  It is not a fair fight.  We start with the advantage of altitude and I am determined to maintain it.  Over time the British scouts are forced lower until the fight is on the deck.  I get a firm shot in at the all tan DH2.  I fire into the cockpit and the plane spins and crashes, a sure sign that the pilot was mortally hit.  I turn onthe otherand fire into him.  Huwyler finishes the job.  Both British pilots were, unfortunately, killed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
