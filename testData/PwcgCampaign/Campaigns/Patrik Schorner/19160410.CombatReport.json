  "narrative": "\nQuite a day!  We fly a patrol mission in our Rolands.  Giant Russian bombers have been attacking the southern front from their northern base.  I decide to freelance and search for them along that path.  I find them!\n\nI attack the lowest in a formation of four.  My first pass scores telling hits on two engines.  As we pass Westerman opens fire from the observers position.  We regin height and make another pass.  This time the damage is telling and the wounded iant falls out of formation.  Unfortunately, we too have had our fuel line cut.  It is too good of an opportunity to let go.  More passes with me firing from the front and Westerman opening up as we pass.  Our fuel runs dry.  I glide underneath to let Westerman get in some parting shots.  We must land but the Russian plane is also stricken.  One by one its engines quit and it crashes, largely intact, just before a stand of trees some miles from us.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
