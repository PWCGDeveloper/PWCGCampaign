  "narrative": "\nTwo victories but a stunning display of  incompetence.  I am livid.  First Schonbaum and Nostitz get tangled up and crash.  Then, as I am trying to pull a Nieuport off of his tail, Fromm clips my wing.  All four aircraft are writeoffs.  \n\nNow the good.  The new Albatros scout is remarkable.  When one uses its power one is not threatened.The two guns make short work of both the French pusher and the Nieuport scout that I bring down.\n",
