  "narrative": "\nAn artillery spot.  We porceed to the target and I am engrossed with my task when we are set upon by a pair of Nieuports.  Bullets fly by, some of them striking our crate but to no effect.  I frantically bring my machine gun to engage and open fire.  The range is point blank and I cannot miss.  After several long bursts the first disintegrates in the air.  The second attacks and I fire a long burst into his engine.  He does not go down but at least he leaves us alone.  I call for artillery fire but the damned artillery will not open up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
