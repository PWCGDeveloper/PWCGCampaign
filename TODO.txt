Beta 1 Fixed
Skins - in game skins for every plane corrected.
Some Typhoon mods availability pushed to mid 1944
Gap in 56 squadron assigned planes
Do not put troops and ground units in place for iconic anti shipping missions
- Mostly impacts Dunkirk 
Added code to not kill pilots who bail out
- Used to avoid killing everybody that bails out over the channel
- If you are going down over water, don't ditch.  PWCG can't pick that up.  Bail out.


Alpha 2 Fixed
Russian skins on British planes
Inappropriate smoke
Inappropriate damage to radar towers
All radio call signs not enabled before August 1941
P-51D introduction too late.  Moved it up to April 1944.
Sometimes unit codes are not used (when a squadron has more than one name over time).
Winter track marks and other winter stuff on Normandy map
Airfield "Plane" is now "Maupertus"

Low Priority
All the post-invasion Allied airfields in Normandy are available as fields before the invasion 
AA in the water:  AA "corridors" at the ends of runways, which sometimes go into the water if the field is right next to the coast.

Remove end date from nigh mission odds

Hi Pat. I noticed in the configured skins for the Spitfire XIV that quite a few skins are labeled Mk. IXe, and also point to the IXe model in the game’s directory instead of to the XIV.
