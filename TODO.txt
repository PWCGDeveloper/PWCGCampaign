Troops in the water near a convoy.
Smoke/Damage still not fixed.


Alpha 3 Fixed
Some Typhoon mods availability pushed to mid 1944
Gap in 56 squadron assigned planes

Alpha 2 Fixed
Russian skins on British planes
Inappropriate smoke
Inappropriate damage to radar towers
All radio call signs not enabled before August 1941
P-51D introduction too late.  Moved it up to April 1944.
Sometimes unit codes are not used (when a squadron has more than one name over time).
Winter track marks and other winter stuff on Normandy map
Airfield "Plane" is now "Maupertus"

Low Priority
All the post-invasion Allied airfields in Normandy are available as fields before the invasion 
AA in the water:  AA "corridors" at the ends of runways, which sometimes go into the water if the field is right next to the coast.
