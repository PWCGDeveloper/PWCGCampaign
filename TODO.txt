Trying to do a paratroop mission with C-47s but they seem always start with canisters instead of paratroopers.

Cant see the new Spitfire C model. Flying an RAF campaign in Normandy, August 44 with 41 squadron. 
Requesting an equipment change does not show the C model. Tried an an existing Bodenplate campaign and its not there either. 
Is it not available in Normandy or Bodenplatte? 


===
When you change fronts, missions won't generate and you can't create that 
front's new pilots unless you exit and then restart the campaign from the main menu.  
No problem, you just need to know to take that step.
