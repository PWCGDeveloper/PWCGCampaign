Little oversight in text fields content. Latest FC version.  Pilot creation screen shows pilot name in all fields.

In the administer pilots in a coop campaign, now I only have add pilot button, the activate pilot and transfer are gone. 
Also, had to resize the fonts, since the buttons to choose the pilot were cut out from the screen no matter other options.

Flying a Stuka campaign and we've been re-located to the Kuban map. We just had a mission over one of the ports to hit a rail facility, 
but whilst there, we noticed that none of the Docks are included. Lots of cranes and buildings, just no concrete docks.

Pat, more often than not, in my missions huge cities are entirely missing even if the objective is located right in them (Lille in my case, for Flying Circus).
That's with the latest version but I had this issue before... it would seem to be more frequent in case of long-distance missions but I am not sure.
All density options are set to High with no other custom values elsewhere.
Is there a way to brutally force PWCG to load up the entire map's structures?

A small issue we've noticed is that when setting a fuel load in the Flying Circus generator, it is not passed on to the Aircraft.
We're flying Sopwith Camels in a campaign and I've put a 60% load in the generator a few times now, but in the plane config in game, it's always at 100%.
