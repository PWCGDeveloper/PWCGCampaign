Weather modifications
The mission will conform to the weather.  You will get much more variety, in particular. lots more rain and snow.  Most battle areas have upwards of 25% rainy days.  

Any given weather pattern may or may not impact a given mission type.  If it is overcast and rainy most of the missions are going to be pushed to low altitude.  
Dive bombing missions are particularly affected.  Dive bombing will be swapped for an attack mission where the Stuka will drop bombs much like a fighter or IL2.  
Tactical bombing will be pushed lower.  
Patrols will be pushed lower.  
Deeper penetration missions will be scrapped in favor of lower altitude missions near the front.  
If cloud cover is not overcast or heavy then you will fly the missions as usual with whatever cloud cover there may be.

Weather related advanced configuration:
Campaign ->Configuration -> Advanced Config -> Weather
Use realistic weather: set to 1 to use weather than includes heavier weather.  Set to 0 to fly in relatively clear skies (Still has clouds but no rain)
Min Haze/Max Haze: Minimum and maximum values for haze. Proper values are 1-10.  This makes use of the new haze feature
Max Wind: Not a new config.  Maximum wind speed in meters per second
Max turbulence: Not a new config.  Proper values are 1-10.  Maximum turbulence value in the mission.
